              <p className="problem-description">
                India's defense infrastructure spans across diverse terrains, from the icy heights of Siachen to the dense forests of the Northeast, 
                from the vast deserts of Rajasthan to the extensive coastlines of the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Each of these environments 
                presents unique challenges that require sophisticated technological solutions. Traditional defense systems, while robust, often 
                operate in silos, creating gaps in communication, delayed response times and inefficient resource allocation.
              </p>
              
              <p className="problem-description">
                The modern battlefield is no longer confined to physical territories. Cyber warfare, information warfare and hybrid threats 
                have expanded the definition of national security. Our armed forces need to simultaneously monitor physical borders, cyber 
                infrastructure, communication networks and intelligence feeds - all while ensuring the safety and effectiveness of our personnel 
                in high-risk operational zones.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{color: '#9ACD32', fontSize: '22px', marginTop: '40px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>Scale of the Challenge</h3>
              <p className="problem-description">
                Consider the magnitude: India has over 15,000 kilometers of land borders with seven countries, a coastline of 7,516 kilometers 
                and an Exclusive Economic Zone of over 2 million square kilometers. Monitoring and securing this vast expanse requires coordination 
                between the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard and various paramilitary forces. Each service has its own communication protocols, 
                data formats and operational procedures, making seamless integration a complex challenge.
              </p>

              <p className="problem-description">
                The human element adds another layer of complexity. Our armed forces comprise over 1.4 million active personnel deployed across 
                diverse environments - from high-altitude posts where temperatures drop to -50°C to desert outposts where they soar above 50°C. 
                These brave men and women need real-time support, accurate intelligence, reliable communication and immediate assistance during 
                emergencies. Current systems often fail to provide this level of integrated support.
              </p>

              <h3 style={{color: '#9ACD32', fontSize: '22px', marginTop: '40px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>Technological Gaps in Current Systems</h3>
              <p className="problem-description">
                Legacy defense systems were designed for a different era. Many still rely on manual processes, paper-based reporting and 
                fragmented communication channels. While these systems have served us well, they are increasingly inadequate for modern threats. 
                Data silos prevent comprehensive threat assessment, delayed information flow hampers quick decision-making and lack of predictive 
                capabilities means we're often reactive rather than proactive.
              </p>

              <p className="problem-description">
                Intelligence gathering and analysis, crucial for national security, often involves processing vast amounts of data from satellites, 
                drones, ground sensors, human intelligence and open-source information. Current systems struggle to correlate this information 
                in real-time, identify patterns, predict threats and provide actionable insights to field commanders and policy makers.
              </p>

              <p className="problem-description">
                Communication between different units, especially in remote areas, faces challenges due to terrain, weather conditions and 
                infrastructure limitations. A patrol unit in Ladakh might lose contact with their base station, a naval vessel in the Indian 
                Ocean might face communication blackouts or an air force squadron might need to coordinate with ground forces using incompatible 
                communication systems.
